Pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP) is the active form of vitamin B6 and acts as an essential, ubiquitous coenzyme in many aspects of amino acid and cellular metabolism (3, 7, 10). PLP is synthesized de novo in Escherichia coli by a pathway that is thought to condense 4-phosphohydroxy-l-threonine (4PHT) and d-1-deoxyxylulose to form pyridoxine 5'-phosphate (PNP) (9, 12, 18-21, 25, 41, 45-47). PNP is then oxidized by the PdxH oxidase to form PLP, the active coenzyme (Fig. 1--------) (4, 24, 26, 27, 38, 48). In addition, PLP can be synthesized by a salvage pathway that utilizes pyridoxal (PL), pyridoxine (PN), and pyridoxamine (PM) taken up from the growth medium (Fig. 1--------) (20, 44). In the salvage pathway, PL, PN, and PM are first phosphorylated by kinases to form PLP, PNP, and pyridoxamine 5'-phosphate (PMP), respectively (Fig. 1---------). PNP and PMP are oxidized by the PdxH oxidase, which functions in both the salvage and de novo pathways (20, 26, 29, 48). Similar salvage pathways are present in mammalian cells, which lack a de novo PLP biosynthetic pathway (5, 6, 17). In mammalian cells, PLP homeostasis is further maintained by the offsetting activities of PL kinases and a PLP-specific phosphatase (13-15). A cytoplasmic PLP phosphatase activity has been detected in E. coli K-12, but it has not yet been determined whether this phosphatase is specific for PLP (43).
We recently reported the identification of the pdxK gene, which encodes a PN kinase (44). Previously, a PN kinase with additional PL and PM kinase activities was purified from E. coli, and it is likely that pdxK encodes this PN/PL/PM kinase (39). This was the first identification of a gene encoding a PN/PL/PM kinase in any organism and led to the rapid identification of a gene encoding a PL kinase in humans (17). A reverse genetics approach was used in the protozoan Trypanosoma brucei to identify a gene encoding a PL kinase, which showed significant homology to E. coli PdxK (34).
We showed previously that a pdxK null mutant lacks PN kinase activity but still contains PL kinase activity that is detectable in bacteria in which de novo PLP biosynthesis is blocked (44). This finding led to the hypothesis that E. coli K-12 contains at least one other PL kinase that converts PL to PLP. Here we confirm this hypothesis by identifying the pdxY gene, which encodes a novel PL kinase whose function is confined to the B6 vitamer salvage pathway. We show further that pdxY is located in a multifunctional operon that contains the gene for the PdxH PNP/PMP oxidase, which functions in both the de novo and salvage pathways of PLP synthesis (Fig. 1---------), and the essential tyrS gene, which encodes aminoacyl-tRNATyr synthetase.

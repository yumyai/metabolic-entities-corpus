The biosynthesis of pyridoxine (vitamin B6; PN) and its ubiquitous, essential coenzyme derivatives, pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP) and pyridoxamine 5'-phosphate (PMP), seems to occur by a branched pathway in Escherichia coli K-12 (Fig. 1) (28). According to one scheme, one branch probably starts with erythrose-4-phosphate and leads to the intermediate 4-hydroxythreonine (19, 28). This branch is catalyzed by the products of the pdxB and serC genes (28).  The other branch may lead to the intermediate D-1-deoxyxylulose, which is likely utilized in the biosynthesis of thiamine (vitamin B1) and riboflavin (vitamin B2) (14, 25, 43).  Because D-1-deoxyxylulose is required in several pathways, its biosynthesis is presently not well understood. The joining of 4-hydroxythreonine and D-1-deoxyxylulose into PN is probably mediated by the products of the pdxA and pdxJ genes, which are the only remaining genes known to be needed exclusively for PN biosynthesis (28). Although their functions are presently unknown, it is clear that pdxcA and pdxJ are not involved in the biosynthesis of the likely precursors, 4-hydroxythreonine and D-1-deoxyxylulose (19, 28). It is also presently unknown whether the PN biosynthetic pathway proposed for E. coli (Fig. 1) is the same as those found in other bacteria or in fungi and plants (42).
PN is then converted to PLP by a two-step pathway that seems to be found in all organisms (42). First, PN is phosphorylated by pyridoxine kinase (PN/PL/PM kinase; pyridoxal kinase; EC 2.7.1.35) to give pyridoxine 5'-phosphate (PNP) (19, 46, 47). In mammals, PNP is next oxidized, using molecular oxygen, to PLP by flavin mononucleotidecontaining pyridoxine phosphate oxidase (PNP/PMP oxidase; pyridoxaminephosphate oxidase; EC 1.4.3.5), which is encoded by pdxH (31, 32, 44). In E. coli K-12, the same PdxH oxidase is required for both aerobic and anaerobic growth (29), implying that molecular oxygen may not be the sole election acceptor (29). Although pyridoxine kinase can also form pyridoxal 5'-phosphate directly from pyridoxal (PL), studies with the purified enzyme suggest that PN is the true substrate and PL is a catabolic product (Fig. 1) (19, 46, 47, 49). Intracellular PMP appears to be synthesized as a by-product of transaminase activities and is not thought to be a primary intermediate of PN (Fig. 1) (19). However, pyridoxamine (PM) can be utilized by mutants that are unable to synthesize PN, because PM and PMP can serve as substrates for PN/PL/PM kinase and PNP/PMP oxidase, respectively (19, 31, 46, 47). Mutants lacking PNP/PMP (PdxH) oxidase can be selected for growth on PL or PM but not on PN (16). pdxH mutants grow on PM because PM is converted to PMP by pyridoxine kinase and PMP can be changed into PLP by transaminases (Fig. 1) (19). Mutants deficient in pyridoxine kinase have never been isolated, presumably because the same kinase is essential for PLP production from PN, PM, and PL (Fig. 1) (19).
An unusual property of the PLP (pdx) biosynthetic genes is their presence in complex operons in E. coli K-12. Of the three pdx genes characterized so far, pdxA is in the surA-pdxA-ksgA-apaG-apaH operon (35, 41), pdxB is in the pdxB-asd'-hisT-dedA operon (38), and serC is in the serC-aroA operon (22, 28). A working hypothesis for the arrangement of these pdx complex operons is that it allows PLP biosynthesis to be genetically interwoven into intermediary metabolism (3, 28, 35). Of these three examples, this model is most compelling for the serC-aroA operon, because pyridoxal 5'-phosphate, serine, and aromatic intermediates and amino acids act together at numerous steps in intermediary metabolism (7).
In this report, we show that only pdxA, pdxB, and pdxH mutants can be obtained in enrichments following insertion mutagenesis. This finding led to a genetic and structural analysis of pdxJ, whose existence was known through point mutations (21). We demonstrate that pdxJ is immediately downstream from the mnc-era-recO complex operon and that pdxJ is itself the first gene in a complex operon with a gene essential for growth of E. coli cells, temporarily designated dpj (downstream of pdxi). Mutations in pdxJ, which are polar on dpj expression, can be suppressed by three classes of second-site mutations. We show that one class of dpj suppressor is in lon, which encodes an important ATP-dependent protease (24), and present a model to account for the other classes of suppressors.

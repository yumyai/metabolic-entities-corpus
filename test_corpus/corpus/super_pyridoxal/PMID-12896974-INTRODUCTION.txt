Pyridoxal 5'-phosphate, the catalytically active form of vitamin B6, is an important cofactor for many enzymes responsible for the metabolic conversions of amino acids. Vitamin B6 (pyridoxine) and its derivatives are also efficient singlet oxygen quenchers and potent fungal antioxidants (1). Two different pathways for de novo synthesis of pyridoxine are now recognized. One of these, found in all Archaea, eukaryotes, and in some bacteria, uses the singlet oxygen resistance (SOR1(Pdx1)) gene product, a highly conserved enzyme (2). A number of eubacteria, including Escherichia coli, utilize a specific pathway for pyridoxal phosphate synthesis that is distinct and has been characterized for some time (3). Analysis of sequences from several genomes has revealed that organisms may encode either the SOR1 or E. coli-like pyridoxine biosynthesis genes, but not both (4).
The pyridoxal 5'-phosphate biosynthesis pathway has been well characterized in E. coli, and consists of six enzymatic steps, beginning with erythrose 4-phosphate and deoxyxylulose 5-phosphate (5-7). All of the enzymes in this pathway have been identified. Of the six enzymes, PdxA,1 erythromate-4-phosphate dehydrogenase (PdxB), and pyridoxine-5'-phosphate oxidase are unique to this pathway (5), whereas SerC and GapA also function in other biosynthetic pathways (5).
The fourth step in this pathway is catalyzed by PdxA (E.C. 1.1.1.262), which converts 4-hydroxy-L-threonine 4-phosphate (HTP) to 3-amino-1-hydroxyacetone 1-phosphate, an oxidative decarboxylation that may involve 2-amino-3-keto-4-hydroxybutyric acid 4-phosphate as an intermediate (8) (Scheme 1). Either NADP+ or NAD+ function as cofactors, whereas the free alcohol 4-hydroxy-L-threonine is not a substrate for the reaction (8). The product of the PdxA reaction is used along with deoxyxylulose 5-phosphate by pyridoxine-5'-phosphate synthase (PdxJ) to generate pyridoxine 5'-phosphate along with inorganic phosphate. This key enzyme functions in closure of the aromatic pyridoxine ring (6, 9, 10).
Treatment of purified PdxA with 1 mM EDTA abolishes oxidation of HTP, suggesting the presence of a tightly bound divalent metal ion. Addition of 1 mM Mn2+, Co2+, Mg2+, or Ca2+ restores full activity (9), whereas 1 mM Ni2+ or 2 mM Zn2+ restored half of the original PdxA activity. Although the product of the reaction, 3-amino-1-hydroxyacetone 1-phosphate, undergoes facile dimerization in the absence of PdxJ and the co-substrate deoxyxylulose phosphate, we have directly detected 3-amino-1-hydroxyacetone 1-phosphate by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry of PdxA incubation mixtures.2 None of the putative intermediate, 2-amino-3-oxo-4-hydroxybutyric acid 4-phosphate, could be detected in the reaction mixture, even as early as 30 s after initiation of the reaction, suggesting that if this compound is formed, it never leaves the PdxA active site.
In principle, PdxA might catalyze either a stepwise or a concerted oxidative decarboxylation of HTP. For example, threonine dehydrogenase catalyzes the biochemically similar, reversible NAD-dependent oxidation of L-threonine to L-2-amino-3-ketobutyrate (Scheme 2) (11). The product, L-2-amino-3-ketobutyrate, which is normally converted to glycine and acetyl-CoA by 2-amino-3-ketobutyrate CoA ligase, can undergo pH-dependent decarboxylation, with a half-life ranging from 8.6 min at pH 5.9 to 140 min at pH 11.1 (12). PdxA and threonine dehydrogenase show no significant amino acid sequence similarity. By contrast, use of the PSI-BLAST sequence comparison algorithm (13) reveals ~30-35% sequence identity over a short ~25 residue segment between E. coli PdxA and both isocitrate dehydrogenase and 3-isopropylmalate dehydrogenases (9). Interestingly, each of the latter two enzymes catalyzes a nicotinamide- and divalent metal ion-dependent oxidative decarboxylation of a b-hydroxy acid substrate (Scheme 2). Significantly, the isocitrate dehydrogenase reaction has been shown to proceed by a stepwise mechanism that involves the corresponding 3-keto acid, oxalosuccinate intermediate, based on multiple isotope effect (2H, 13C) studies, as well as the ability of isocitrate dehydrogenase to catalyze both the decarboxylation and the reduction of oxalosuccinate, with a ~10-fold preference for decarboxylation (14).
Structural characterization of the enzymes of the pyridoxine biosynthetic pathway has so far been limited to E. coli PdxJ (15-17) and pyridoxine-5'-phosphate oxidase from Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Protein Data Bank number 1CIO), the enzyme that oxidizes pyridoxine 5'-phosphate and pyridoxamine 5'-phosphate to pyridoxal 5'-phosphate. The x-ray structure of PdxA bound to Zn2+ as well as the HTP presented here reveals a protein that can be divided into two subdomains, and which shares structural similarities with both isocitrate dehydrogenase and isopropylmalate dehydrogenase. These structural similarities and, in addition, sequence conservation between PdxA and the two dehydrogenases of residues involved in the cofactor binding argue for a similar manner of nicotinamide cofactor binding and similar, stepwise, biochemical mechanisms for oxidative decarboxylation. Furthermore, based on the complex with HTP in the presence of Zn2+, sequence conservation analysis among PdxA enzymes from different sources, and structural comparison with the isocitrate dehydrogenase family, the location of the PdxA active site is stipulated to be in a cleft between the two subdomains and at the interface between the two molecules of the dimer, involving a cluster of strictly conserved amino acids.

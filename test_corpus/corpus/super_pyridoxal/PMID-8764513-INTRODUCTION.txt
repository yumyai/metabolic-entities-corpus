Pyridoxine (PN) kinase catalyzes the phosphorylation of PN (vitamin B6) to pyridoxine 5'-phosphate (PNP), which is then oxidized to the coenzyme pyridoxal S-phosphate (PLP) by PNP/pyridoxamine 5'-phosphate (PMP) oxidase (Fig. 1) [l-4]. Escherichia coli PN kinase was purified to electrophoretic homogeneity and found to use PL and PM as well as PN as substrates [3]. The E. coli PN/PL/PM kinase and the pdxH-encoded PNP/PMP oxidase function in a salvage pathway that interconverts both exogenous and endogenous B6 vitamers (Fig. 1) [1-4]. A B6 vitamer salvage pathway analogous to the one of E. coli is present in mammalian cells, which lack a de novo pathway of PLP biosynthesis [5-8]. The purified E. coli and mammalian PN/PL/PM kinases or PNP/PMP oxidases share several biochemical properties, including negative feedback inhibition by PL or PLP, respectively (Fig. 1) [3,4]. This regulation may play an important role in controlling the amounts of the PLP coenzyme in cells and specific tissues [1-8].
E. coli PNPIPMP oxidase functions in both the de novo pathway of PLP biosynthesis and the B6-vitamer salvage pathway (Fig. 1) [1,2,4]. Until recently, it was unclear whether the E. coli PN/PL/PM kinase also functions in the de novo pathway of PLP biosynthesis. Mutants deficient in PN/PL/PM kinase activity have not been reported suggesting that the PN/ PL/PM kinase might play an essential role in the de novo pathway of PLP biosynthesis [1,2,9]. However, earlier genetic screens were hampered by the inability of E. coli to take up PLP directly [9]. Alternatively, the failure to find PN/PL/PM kinase mutants may have been due to enzymatic redundancy or the function of the kinase in an additional biosynthetic path- way. Consistent with the latter idea, the hydroxy-methylpyrimidine kinase involved in thiamin biosynthesis was found to have kinase activities for PL, PM and PN [10]. 
Recently, we showed that 4-phosphohydroxy-L-threonine is an obligatory intermediate in the de novo pathway of PLP biosynthesis [I 11. This finding implies that PNP, rather than PN, is the first B6 vitamer synthesized by the main de novo PLP biosynthetic pathway (Fig. 1) and that PN/PL/PM kinase is confined to the B6-vitamer salvage pathway [11]. In this paper, we present the first identification of a PN/PL/PM kinase gene. Mutants lacking PN/ PL/PM kinase confirmed our previous conclusions [11] and show that E. coli K-12 contains an additional PL kinase.

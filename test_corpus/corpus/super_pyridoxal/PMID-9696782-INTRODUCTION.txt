Pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP) is an essential coenzyme used by many enzymes involved in amino acid metabolism and by glycogen phosphorylases (reviewed in references 7, 12, and 16). PLP is thought to be synthesized in Escherichia coli by the convergence of two pathways (Fig. 1) (10, 18, 19, 25). The two branches lead to the synthesis of 4-phosphohydroxy-l-threonine (4PHT) and 1-deoxy-d-xylulose 5-phosphate, which are condensed by the PdxA and PdxJ enzymes to form pyridoxine 5'-phosphate (PNP) (Fig. 1) (6, 23). PNP is oxidized by the PdxH enzyme to form the active PLP coenzyme (24, 29, 39) (Fig. 1). PLP is converted to pyridoxamine 5'-phosphate (PMP) by the half-reaction of transaminases (4, 12) (Fig. 1). PMP is recycled back to PLP by the second half-reaction of transaminases and by PdxH oxidase (29, 39).
Overwhelming genetic and biochemical evidence implicate 4PHT as an obligatory intermediate that provides the phosphate ester group of PNP (13, 35, 37). 4PHT biosynthesis is thought to start with d-erythrose-4-phosphate (E4P), which is oxidized by an E4P dehydrogenase to 4-phosphoerythronate (4PE) (Fig.1, branch 1). 4PE is further oxidized by the PdxB dehydrogenase and transaminated by the SerC (PdxF) enzyme to form 4PHT (Fig. 1). Three pieces of evidence support this scheme. First, tktA tktB double mutants, which lack transketolase activity and cannot synthesize E4P or the six aromatic amino acids and vitamins (Fig. 1), are pyridoxine (PN) auxotrophs (38). Second, purified PdxB enzyme oxidizes 4PE in a nonsustained reaction (36). Last, the SerC (PdxF) enzyme uses 4PHT as a substrate in the reverse transamination reaction (13). As expected from this scheme, pdxB and serC (pdxF) mutants are PN auxotrophs, but no single mutation that blocked the first E4P dehydrogenase step in branch 1 of the pathway was identified (10, 23).
Previous studies of epd (gapB). We proposed and confirmed that the gapB gene, which we renamed epd, encoded a nonphosphorylating E4P dehydrogenase (36). The E4P dehydrogenase activity of the Epd enzyme was verified by Boschi-Muller et al. (5), who further identified amino acids in Epd required for E4P dehydrogenase activity and showed that Epd has low-level phosphorylating and nonphosphorylating glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (G3P) dehydrogenase activities in the presence and absence of inorganic phosphate, respectively. However, this G3P dehydrogenase activity is not sufficient to allow the growth of gapA mutants, which lack the major G3P dehydrogenase of E. coli (9, 20). Conversely, Boschi-Muller et al. showed that the GapA dehydrogenase of Bacillus stearothermophilus has a low level of phosphorylating E4P dehydrogenase activity, but this result was not extended to the E. coli GapA enzyme (5).
Recently Della Seta et al. (9) reported that E. coli gapB single and gapA gapB double mutants do not show a growth requirement for B6 vitamers, such as PN and pyridoxal (PL), which can be converted to PLP and PMP by a salvage pathway (34, 35). If this finding were correct, then it would argue against a requirement for an E4P dehydrogenase in PLP biosynthesis (Fig. 1). We performed experiments similar to those of Della Seta et al. using what should be equivalent strains in three different E. coli genetic backgrounds. In contrast to their results, we found that gapA gapB mutants are indeed auxotrophic for B6 vitamers and that gapB mutants are impaired for growth without PN under some growth conditions.

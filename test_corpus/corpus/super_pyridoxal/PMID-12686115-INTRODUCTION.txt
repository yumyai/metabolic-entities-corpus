1. Introduction: synthesis of vitamin B6
The metabolism of vitamin B6 (pyridoxine, PN) has been studied for several decades now. During the early years, only the so-called salvage pathway was known, where all six B6 vitamers [PN; pyridoxal, PL; pyridoxamine, PM; and their corresponding 5'-phosphorylated derivatives pyridoxine 5'-phosphate (PNP), PLP, PMP] can be interconverted and recycled by the action of several transaminases, oxidases and kinases. More recently, it was demonstrated that some organisms (bacteria, fungi and plants) can carry out the de novo synthesis of vitamin B6[1], [2], [3] and [4]. For these organisms, vitamin B6 is not an essential nutrient as it is for mammals and thus they do not need to obtain any of the vitamers through dietary means. Remarkably, two independent and autoexclusive biosynthetic machineries exist. One machinery consists of the pdx family, restricted to some eubacteria, while the other is constructed by SOR1 and homologues, which are broadly distributed. Intriguingly, although these two groups of genes are among the most conserved in nature, no sequence homology is shared between them. The pdx family is by far best characterised in Escherichia coli. From the six pdx genes, two of them, gapB and serC, are involved in other metabolic processes, but pdxA, pdxB, pdxJ and pdxH are unique for vitamin B6 biosynthesis. The latter genes are present in complex operons in E. coli, indicating that vitamin B6 biosynthesis is integrated deeply into the intermediary metabolism [5]. A further regulatory strategy might implicate the so-called PDX box, a conserved sequence found upstream from translation start in pdxA, pdxB and pdxJ [6] and [7]. PdxA is a NAD-dependent dehydrogenase needed for the formation of the unstable compound 1-amino-acetone-3-phosphate (AAP) from 4-(phosphohydroxy)-l-threonine (4-HTP). PdxJ catalyses the final metabolic step, a complicated ring closure reaction between the two acyclic compounds 1-deoxy-d-xylulose-5-phosphate (DXP) and AAP to form PNP and inorganic phosphate (Pi) (Scheme 1). Therefore, PdxJ was renamed PNP synthase. Accordingly, PNP is the first biosynthesised B6 vitamer, which can subsequently enter the salvage pathway and for example be oxidised to PLP by PdxH [8] and [9]. PLP is the biocatalytically active form of vitamin B6. It is one of nature's most versatile cofactors and is the central enzymatic cofactor in amino acid metabolism.
Laber et al. [10] characterised the formation of PNP in E. coli. One of their experiments was a cochromatography, in which results reported that no product was formed in the presence of 1-deoxy-d-xylulose instead of DXP. Additionally, UV and fluorescence spectroscopy and the following of radiolabelled precursors reinforced the finding that the phosphate group of DXP is essential for the reaction to take place. Cane et al. [11] independently arrived at the same conclusions through the results of radioactivity as well as 31P NMR experiments. Both groups proposed speculative schemes for the reaction mechanism. These proposed mechanisms differ in the order of the individual mechanistic steps.
An alternative and recently discovered mechanistic pathway for PNP biosynthesis begins with glutamine [12]. The main clue is the participation of the SOR1 gene in Cercospora fungi [13] and [14] and Aspergillus nidulans[12]. This gene product was initially identified as the responsible element for photosensitiser resistance in Cercospora. However, the strong conservation of SOR1 in no light-sensitive organisms suggested a possible metabolic role that turned out to imply vitamin B6 biosynthesis.

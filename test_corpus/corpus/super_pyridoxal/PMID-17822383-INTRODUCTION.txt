The term vitamin B6 refers to pyridoxal, pyridoxine, pyridoxamine and their respective 5'-phosphorylated forms (http://www.chem.qmul.ac.uk/iupac/misc/B6.html). The chemical entity present at the 4' position of the pyridine ring defines the different vitamers, which can be an aldehyde (pyridoxal), an alcohol (pyridoxol/pyridoxine) or an amine (pyridoxamine) (Scheme 1A). The vitamin is an essential metabolite in all organisms. It is well known in its enzyme cofactor forms PLP (pyridoxal 5'-phosphate) and PMP (pyridoxamine 5'-phosphate). PLP is necessary for over 100 enzymatic reactions, predominantly in amino acid metabolism [1,2]. It has been described as one of Nature's most versatile cofactors in that it participates in transamination, decarboxylation, racemization, Ca-Cb bond cleavage and a,b-elimination reactions [3]. The unifying principle of all of these transformations is the function of the pyridine ring as an electron sink which stabilizes negative charges generated at the a-carbon of the substrate during the respective reactions [1,4,5]. PLP has also been implicated as a precursor of vitamin B1 (thiamine) biosynthesis in yeast [6,7]. On the other hand, PMP has been reported to play an important role in the biosynthesis of deoxysugars [8]. Thus vitamin B6 is implicated in more bodily functions than any other single nutrient (Scheme 1A), and, in more general terms, it is associated with, for example, nervous system function (e.g. serotonin synthesis) [9,10], red blood cell formation (haem biosynthesis) [11], vitamin B3 (niacin) formation [12,13] and one-carbon metabolism (e.g. nucleic acid synthesis) [14]. In addition, the vitamin may function as a regulator of a number of membrane ion transporters [15-17], and it has been linked to modulation of hormone function because of its ability to bind to steroid receptors [18], as well as modulation of transcription factors [19]. There is growing evidence that the vitamin may also have a novel role as an anti-tumour agent [20]. Recently, a completely unprecedented function of vitamin B6 as an antioxidant was uncovered, with a potency equivalent to that of vitamins C and E [21-23].
Only micro-organisms and plants have the ability to synthesize vitamin B6; other organisms must acquire it through their diet. Two independent pathways for the de novo biosynthesis of the vitamin are currently known. Considerable progress has been made in defining structural and functional relationships of both of these pathways in recent years. In the present review, we summarize these advancements and use the available information to provide a detailed structural and functional comparison of the key enzymes involved. A mechanistic evaluation provides unexpected insights into the evolutionary conundrum of two independent routes to the same molecule. We highlight remaining challenges and forecast what is to be expected in this emerging field.

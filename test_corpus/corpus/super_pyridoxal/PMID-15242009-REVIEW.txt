Vitamin B6 (B6), a water-soluble vitamin, was first discovered as an anti-dermatitis factor of rats (1), and then, six forms of B6, pyridoxine (PN), pyridoxine 5'-phosphate (PNP), pyridoxal (PL), pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP), pyridoxamine (PM), and pyridoxamine 5'-phosphate (PMP), were defined (2) (Fig. 1).
Subsequently, an important role of B6 was discovered (3). Among six forms of B6, PLP was required for decarboxylation and transamination of amino acids as a coenzyme. Since then, it has been recognized that PLP plays an important role in metabolic reactions of various amino acids and others. To earn the active coenzyme form of B6, microorganisms and others convert from other B6 compounds to PLP via the salvage pathway. The pathway serves to convert from whatever forms of B6 enter the cell to the active coenzyme form, PLP (Fig. 1). It also became apparent that B6 quenches singlet oxygen, and is one of the most efficient biological antioxidants (4).
The de novo biosynthesis of B6 has been studied with Escherichia coil and other microorganisms. In E. coil, pdx genes, along with others, are believed to be involved in B6 biosynthesis. Some compounds are proposed as a precursor of B6. From these studies, at least three biosynthetic pathways are proposed. In some microorganisms other than E. coli, snz/sno gene homologues are believed to be involved in B6 biosynthesis. However, the entire biosynthetic pathway of B6 has not been revealed in any of the microorganisms. In this review, we present the current summary of B6 biosynthesis of E. coil and other microorganisms.

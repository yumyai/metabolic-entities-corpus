Involvement of the gapA- and epd (gapB)-encoded dehydrogenases in pyridoxal 5'-phosphate coenzyme biosynthesis in Escherichia coli K-12.
We show that epd (gapB) mutants lacking an erythrose 4-phosphate (E4P) dehydrogenase are impaired for growth on some media and contain less pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP) and pyridoxamine 5'-phosphate (PMP) than their epd+ parent. In contrast to a previous report, we found that gapA epd double mutants lacking the glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate and E4P dehydrogenases are auxotrophic for pyridoxine. These results implicate the GapA and Epd dehydrogenases in de novo PLP and PMP coenzyme biosynthesis.

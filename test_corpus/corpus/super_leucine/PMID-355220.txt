Threonine degradation by Serratia marcescens.
The wild strain of Serratia marcescens rapidly degraded threonine and formed aminoacetone in a medium containing glucose and urea. Extracts of this strain showed high threonine dehydrogenase and "biosynthetic" threonine deaminase activities, but no threonine aldolase activity. Threonine dehydrogenase-deficient strain Mu-910 was selected among mutants unable to grow on threonine as the carbon source. This strain did not form aminoacetone from threonine, but it slowly degraded threonine. Strain D-60, deficient in both threonine dehydrogenase and threonine deaminase, was derived from strain Mu-910 and barely degraded threonine. A glycine-requiring strain derived from the wild strain grew in minimal medium containing threonine as the glycine source, whereas a glycine-requiring strain derived from strain Mu-910 did not grow. This indicates that threonine dehydrogenase participates in glycine formation from threonine (via alpha-amino-beta-ketobutyrate) as well as in threonine degradation to aminoacetone.

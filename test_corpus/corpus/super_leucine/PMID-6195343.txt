Transcription initiation sites of the leucine operons of Salmonella typhimurium and Escherichia coli.
Evidence for a transcription attenuation site downstream from the leu promoter was obtained by transcription experiments in vitro. Most transcription initiated in vitro from leuP is terminated prematurely, resulting in the synthesis of a 160 nucleotide leader RNA. We define here the point at which transcription is initiated in vitro and in vivo and demonstrate that the site of premature termination is between the promoter and the first structural gene (leuA). Additional nucleotide sequences are presented that extend the known sequence 200 base-pairs upstream and 300 base-pairs downstream from leuP. The location of the promoter-proximal end of cistron leuA was deduced by comparing nucleotide sequence data with the sequence of the ten amino acids at the N-terminus of alpha-isopropylmalate synthase. To facilitate the isolation of quantities of material for sequencing experiments, the enzyme was isolated from a plasmid-containing strain, CV605, grown under conditions of leucine limitation. Under such conditions, about 20% of the total soluble protein of strain CV605 is alpha-isopropylmalate synthase and another 20% is beta-isopropylmalate dehydrogenase (leuB product).

The enzyme acetohydroxy adcid reductoisomerase (2,3-dihydroxyisovalerate:NADP+ oxidoreductase; EC 1.1.1.86)is found in the branched-chain amino acid biosynthetic pathway. It catalyzes the reaction indicated in eq 1. The two natural substrates for the enzyme differ in the identity of the R group that undergoes migration. In compound I, when R is methyl, biosynthesis proceeds to ultimately produce either valine or leucine. For the compound where R is ethyl, the ultimate product is The enzyme reaction is unique in that an intramolecularalkyl transfer occurs without the intervention of cobalamin or any other organic cofactor. The enzyme activity is dependent on the presence of a divalent magnesium ion (Armstrong & Wagner, 1961).
The reductoisomerase from Salmonella typhimurium is a tetramer of identical subunits having a molecular weight of 220000. This tetramer catalyzes both the migration and reduction steps of the chemical transformation of acetolactate to dihydroxyisovalerate (11, eq 1). Umbarger partially purified the enzyme from Escherichia coli (Umbarger et al., 1960) and obtained a homogeneous preparation from S. typhimurium (Arfin & Umbarger, 1969). Using this enzyme, he characterized the basic aspects of the reaction. Hoefler also reported the purification of the enzyme from S . typhimurium (Hoefler et al., 1975). Shematek investigated part of the steady-state kinetic mechanism of the enzyme from this source (Shematek et al., 1973). Initial velocity patterns for the forward reaction in the presence and absence of products indicated an ordered bi-bi mechanism. The steady-state parameters for the reverse reaction were not reported.
The stereochemistry of the reaction is known. That (2S)-acetolactate (I, R = Me) and (2s)-acetohydroxybutyrate (I, R = Et) were the substrates for the reaction was established by the work of Crout (Armstrong et al., 1974, 1983) and, independently, Hill (Hill et al., 1979). The product diol resulting from the reaction of acetolactate has the 2R configuration, while that from acetohydroxybutyrate has the 2R,3R configuration (Hill & Yan, 1971;Crout & Whitehouse, 1972). Using 13C-labeled acetolactate, Crout showed that the 2-methyl group that undergoes migration occupies the pro-R position in the product 2,3-dihydroxy-3-methylbutyrat(eCrout et al., 1980). In acetohydroxybutyrate, the migrating ethyl group retains its stereochemistry at the methylene carbon in the product diol (Cahill et al., 1980). The reductoisomerase is able to catalyze the reduction of ketopantoate to produce pantoate (the intermediate in coenzyme A biosynthesis) which again requires that the reduction half-reaction produce a 2-(R)-hydroxy acid (Primerano & Burns, 1983). Finally, the reduction step requires the transfer of the pro-S hydrogen from NADPH' (Arfin & Umbarger, 1969).
The expression of the gene (ilvC) for the reductoisomerase is regulated by an activator protein encoded by the ilvY gene. The substrates for the reductoisomerase are bound by the Y protein, thereby inducing the synthesis of the enzyme. Other substrate analogues are capable of inducing the synthesis of the reductoisomerase, although at reduced levels (Arfin et al., 1969). The genes for E. coli ilvC and ilvY have recently been cloned into a multicopy plasmid (Wek & Hatfield, 1986) and the sequences determined. Since the plasmid carries both genes, the concentration of the activator protein Y is never limiting.
There is current interest in the biosynthetic pathway of the branched-chain amino acids and in the mechanism of reductoisomerase. The sulfonyl urea and imidazolinone herbicides are known to inhibit the biosynthesis of these amino acids (Chaleff & Mauvais, 1984; Shaner et al., 1984). The point of inhibition is acetolactate synthase, the enzyme that precedes reductoisomerase in the pathway. Our interest in the reductoisomerase enzyme centers on the chemical mechanism for the alkyl migration step. We have taken advantage of the mode of expression of ilvC to induce recombinant bacteria to synthesize large amounts of enzyme. In this paper, we report the purification of the enzyme from this source as well as steady-state kinetic analyses of the forward and reverse reactions. We have also determined the kinetics of the enzyme reaction using the intermediate 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-2-oxobutyrate. Finally, we present the results of kinetic isotope effect studies on the reduction aspect of the enzyme reaction.

Acetohydroxyacid synthase (AHAS, formerly EC 4.1.3.18, now EC 2.2.1.6) is a thiamin diphosphate (ThDP)-dependent enzyme which catalyzes the first common step in the biosynthesis of the branched-chain amino acids valine, leucine and isoleucine. In this reaction, enzyme-bound ThDP reacts with pyruvate, which undergoes decarboxylation to form a ThDP-bound active intermediate. Condensation of this intermediate with a second a-ketoacid, either a second pyruvate or 2-ketobutyrate, leads to the products acetolactate or acetohydroxybutyrate, respectively (Fig. 1). While many prototrophic organisms express a single AHAS, Escherichia coli , Salmonella typhimurium and other enterobacteria encode three isozymes of AHAS that differ in their biochemical properties. These include specificity towards substrates, sensitivity to inhibition by valine, and affinity for cofactors. The expression of each isozyme is regulated in a different way [1] and each presumably has a slightly different metabolic role [2,3].
Each of the enterobacterial isozymes has been shown to be composed of large (?60 kDa) and small (9 D 17 kDa) subunits in equimolar amounts [4 D 6]. Sequence alignment of AHASs from enterobacteria with other AHAS genes suggests that AHAS III is quite similar to ""typical"" bacterial AHASs, while enterobacterial isozymes I and II are different and each have small subunits (SSUs) about half the size (9D 11 kDa) of those of typical bacterial AHASs. In addition, AHAS I seems to show a pattern of inhibition by valine different from that observed for, e.g., AHAS III [7], for the single AHAS of Mycobacterium avium [8] or for AHAS from Bacillus stearothermophilus [9].
AHAS I has a uniquely low preference (about 1.5- to 2- fold) for 2-ketobutyrate over pyruvate as a second substrate, while isozymes II and III prefer 2-ketobutyrate by 60- and 40- fold, respectively [10]. As expected, the large, catalytic subunit (LSU) of AHAS I differs from most other bacterial AHASs at several amino acid positions in its presumed active site. In addition, the operon ilvBN, which encodes AHAS I in E. coli, is subject to unusual regulation: it is the only biosynthetic operon in E. coli that is induced by the cAMP- dependent inducer protein of the Catabolite Repression system [1,11].
All the above differences in properties of AHAS I suggest that this isozyme has a special metabolic role in the enterobacteria. However, the connection between this role and the enzymatic properties of AHAS I is still not completely understood [2,3,12,13]. We report here the biochemical characterization of isolated AHAS I, which reveals additional, unexpected differences in catalytic behavior between this isozyme and other AHAS isozymes.

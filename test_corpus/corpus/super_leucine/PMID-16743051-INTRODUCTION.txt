A number of alternative routes of L-threonine catabolism have been demonstrated in bacteria. Only more recently have the biochemical and phylogenetic significance of these routes been examined (Bell et al., 1972; Bell & Turner, 1976a).
In most bacteria capable of growth on L-threonine, the amino acid is metabolized by the initial action of L-threonine 3-dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.103). The product of this oxidation, 2-amino-3-oxobutyrate, is cleaved to acetyl-CoA and glycine by the action of a CoA-ligase (Bell & Turner, 1976a; McGilvray & Morris, 1969). L-Threonine aldolase (EC 2.1.2.1)-initiated dissimilation has been demonstrated in a limited number of bacteria (Morris, 1969; Willetts &Turner, 1971 ; Kumagai et al., 1972). Studies of L-threonine catabolism initiated by 'catabolic' L-threonine dehydratase (L-threonine hydrolyase, EC 4.2.1.16) have concentrated on two bacteria grown anaerobically on media containing high concentrations of the amino acid (Umbarger & Brown, 1957; Tokushige & Hayaishi, 1972).
A survey of isolates capable of growth on Lthreonine (Bell et al., 1972) revealed a group of three organisms (Corynebacterium sp. F5, Brevibacterium spp. F9 and GI) which possessed substantial L-threonine dehydratase activity to the exclusion ofanyother threonine-catabolizing enzyme. The properties of the dehydratase indicated that it was, in common with that of other isolates, a 'biosynthetic' isoenzyme. The route of L-threonine catabolism in these bacteria and the metabolic role of the 'biosynthetic' L-threonine dehydratases have nowbeen examined. Evidence for metabolism via 2-oxobutyrate and propionate and its relationship with branched-chain amino acid catabolism is presented.

Leucine biosynthesis in enteric bacteria is catalyzed by three enzymes whose levels are co-ordinately regulated by the intracellular concentration of leucine (Calvo et al., 1969a). These three enzymes are encoded by four genes which are clustered into an operon on the chromosomes of Salmonella typhimurium and Escherichia coll. In vitro, transcription initiated at the leu promoter terminates with high efficiency at a site approximately 160 nucleotides downstream (Gemmill et al., 1979). The resulting transcript, termed the leu leader RNA, is similar in many respects to leader RNAs transcribed from other promoters (Yanofsky, 1981). It can code for a 28 amino acid peptide that includes four adjacent Leu residues and it has the potential for forming several mutually exclusive secondary structures (Keller & Cairo, 1979). On the basis of such similarities and of the transcription studies in vitro, we suggested that the leu operon is controlled by a transcription attenuation mechanism. Additional studies, involving analysis of regulatory mutations and of the rates of synthesis and degradation of leu messenger RNA, firmly establish attenuation as an important mechanism by which the leu operon is regulated (Searles et al., 1983). Moreover, these latter studies suggest that for cells grown in a minimal medium, transcription attenuation may be the only mechanism by which leucine regulates expression of the leu operon.
The studies reported here establish some of the basic parameters of this system.  Nucleotide sequences from S. typhimurium that extend the known sequences 200 base-pairs upstream and 300 base-pairs downstream from the leu promoter are presented. These latter sequences contain information for part of the sequence of a-isopropylmalate synthase and thereby define the promoter-proximal end of cistron leuA. We further define here the exact point at which transcription is initiated in vitro and in vivo and demonstrate that the site of premature termination is located between the promoter and the first structural gene.

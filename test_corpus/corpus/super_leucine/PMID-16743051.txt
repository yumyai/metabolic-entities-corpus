Bacterial catabolism of threonine. Threonine degradation initiated by l-threonine hydrolyase (deaminating) in a species of Corynebacterium.
1. Three bacterial isolates capable of growth on l-threonine medium only when supplemented with branched-chain amino acids, and possessing high l-threonine dehydratase activity, were examined to elucidate the catabolic route for the amino acid. 2. Growth, manometric, radiotracer and enzymic experiments indicated that l-threonine was catabolized by initial deamination to 2-oxobutyrate and thence to propionate. No evidence was obtained for the involvement of l-threonine 3-dehydrogenase or l-threonine aldolase in threonine catabolism. 3. l-Threonine dehydratase of Corynebacterium sp. F5 (N.C.I.B. 11102) was partially purified and its kinetic properties were examined. The enzyme exhibited a sigmoid kinetic response to substrate concentration. The concentration of substrate giving half the maximum velocity, [S(0.5)], was 40mm and the Hill coefficient (h) was 2.0. l-Isoleucine inhibited enzyme activity markedly, causing 50% inhibition at 60mum, but did not affect the Hill constant. At the fixed l-threonine concentration of 10mm, the effect of l-valine was biphasic, progressive activation occurring at concentrations up to 2mm-l-valine, but was abolished by higher concentrations. Substrate-saturation plots for the l-valine-activated enzyme exhibited normal Michaelis-Menten kinetics with a Hill coefficient (h) of 1.0. The kinetic properties of the enzyme were thus similar to those of the ;biosynthetic' isoenzyme from Rhodopseudomonas spheroides rather than those of the enteric bacteria. 4. The synthesis of l-threonine dehydratase was constitutive and was not subject to multivalent repression by l-isoleucine or other branched-chain amino acids either singly or in combination. 5. The catabolism of l-threonine, apparently initiated by a ;biosynthetic' l-threonine dehydratase in the isolates studied, depended on the concomitant catabolism of branched-chain amino acids. The biochemical basis of this dependence appeared to lie in the further catabolism of 2-oxobutyrate by enzymes which required branched-chain 2-oxo acids for their induction.

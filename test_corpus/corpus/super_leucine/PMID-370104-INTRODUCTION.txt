The acetohydroxy acid synthases (EC 4.1.3.18) of microorganisms have been found to catalyze two homologous reactions involving the condensation of an active acetaldehyde group derived from pyruvate, with either pyruvate, to form acetolactate, or a-ketobutyrate, to form acetohydroxybutyrate, obligatory intermediates in the biosynthesis of valine and isoleucine, respectively. In Salmonella typhimurium and Escherichia coli, the enzymes have resisted purification owing to the instability of the proteins (1, 3, 5, 20). Until recently, it has been unclear how many enzymes were involved because of the lack of mutants completely deficient in acetohydroxy acid synthase activity. It was clear that S. typhimurium contained two isozymic forms; one, sensitive to inhibition by valine, was repressed by leucine plus valine, and a second, not inhibited by valine, required isoleucine, valine, and perhaps leucine as well for its repression (3, 20). On the other hand, the K-12 strain of E. coli contained only a valine-sensitive activity unless the strain bore an ilvO mutation, in which case a valine-insensitive isozyme could be formed under derepressing conditions (3, 5, 20). A strain of E. coli, 9723, that is normally valine insensitive was recently shown to have an isozyme pattern like that of S. typhimurium (24).
(This study also demonstrated a third activity which was active at a lower pH, was insensitive to valine, and was concluded not to be involved in branched-chain amino acid biosynthesis.) The unexpected complication in the K-12 strain was that the valine-sensitive activity resided not in a single enzyme but in two different enzymes (11).
The work of the Naples group (11, 12) has led to the proposal of a gene-enzyme relationship in E. coli K-12 to account for the three acetohydroxy acid synthases. Acetohydroxy acid synthase I is one of the two valine-sensitive enzymes and was shown to be specified by the ilvB gene, but there is uncertainty regarding the location of this gene. Acetohydroxy acid synthase II was shown to be specified by a gene in the ilv cluster, ilvG, the expression of which is dependent upon ilvO (valine resistance) mutations. Finally, acetohydroxy acid synthase III was shown to be the product of a locus near the leu operon which was proposed to contain two genes, ilvH and ilvI. However, owing to the limited evidence for two separate genes, the locus will here be referred to as the ilvHI gene. The third isozyme was recently shown by DeFelice and Levinthal (9) to be strongly repressed by leucine alone.
A clear understanding of this gene-enzyme relationship will be dependent not only upon a more careful genetic analysis than has been performed until now but also upon a distinction among the three isozymes. Attempts to accomplish the latter in this laboratory have now been undertaken. This paper demonstrates ways to distinguish the three isozymes and describes in detail some properties of acetohydroxy acid synthase I, which has been purified to near homogeneity.

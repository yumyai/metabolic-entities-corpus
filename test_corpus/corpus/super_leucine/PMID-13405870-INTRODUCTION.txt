The identity of L-serine and L-threonine deaminases in Escherichia coli with a single enzyme protein was suggested by Wood and Gunsalus (1949), who were unable to effect any separation of the two activities following extensive purification. In contrast, Sayre and Greenberg (1956) were able to demonstrate that the two activities in sheep liver were due to separate enzymes. With bacterial systems, evidence that the deamination of L-serine and that of L-threonine are catalyzed by different enzymes is only indirect. For example, on the basis of the effect of varying growth conditions upon the relative rates of deamination of L-serine and L-threonine, Dawes (1952), Boyd and Lichstein (1955) and Pardee and Prestidge (1955) have concluded that at least two enzymes are involved.
Evidence is presented here for recognition in E. coli extracts of two distinctly different enzymes catalyzing the deamination of L-threonine. In each case, the activity against L-threonine is accompanied by activity against L-serine. One appears to be an adaptive enzyme that is formed best under the conditions of growth used by Wood and Gunsalus (1949); this enzyme is referred to as the Wood and Gunsalus L-threonine deaminase. Some of the properties of the second enzyme deaminating L-threonine have been reported (Umbarger and Brown, 1956), but it was not distinguished from the Wood and Gunsalus enzyme. This enzyme can now be identified by its sensitivity to inhibition by L-isoleucine (Umbarger, 1956b). Its obligatory role in the biosynthesis of L-isoleucine has already been reported (Umbarger, 1956a). Therefore, it is referred to in this paper as the biosynthetic L-threonine deaminase.
In addition to the enzymes described above which appear to attack both L-serine and Lthreonine, evidence has been obtained for a third enzyme which can utilize only L-serine. With the recognition of these three deaminases, the apparently conflicting reports of other workers can be verified and a unified interpretation can be formulated.

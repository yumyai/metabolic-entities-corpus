In wild-type strains of Escherichia coli, the first three steps in leucine biosynthesis are catalyzed by enzymes encoded by the leuABCD operon, while the last step, the amination of 2-ketoisocaproate (2-KIC) to leucine, is catalyzed by two independent enzymes: the branched chain amino acid transaminase (transaminase B, TrB), encoded by dyE, and the tyrosine-repressible transaminase (transaminase D, TrD), encoded by tyrB (3) (Fig. 1). leuA, leuB, leuC, and leuD mutant strains can grow on either leucine or 2-KIC, while ilvE tyrB double mutants can grow on leucine but not on 2-KIC and ilvE or tyrB single mutants do not require either metabolite (10).
The transaminases encoded by two other genes, aspC (TrA) and avtA (TrC), do not catalyze physiologically detectable leucine synthesis when present in a single copy in the chromosome, but when either gene is present on a multicopy plasmid, the leucine requirement of an ilvE tyrB mutant is suppressed. Thus, when overproduced, these two transaminases can also catalyze leucine synthesis in vivo (7).
Here we describe the isolation, characterization, and mapping of a TnS-induced presumptive tyrB mutation in an ilvE strain. Although the mutation conferred an absolute requirement for leucine that could not be satisfied by 2-KIC, which is the phenotype expected of an ilvE tyrB double mutant, the Tn5 insertion was found to be in the leu leader region. Other ilvE leu double mutants also were unable to grow on 2-KIC. The data indicate that the inability of ilvE leu double mutants to grow on 2-KIC is due to intracellular 2-ketoisovalerate (2-KIV) accumulation, which has an inhibitory effect on TrD in leucine synthesis.

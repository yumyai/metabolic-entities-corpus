Dihydroxy-acid dehydratase (2,3-dihydroxy-acid hydrolyase, EC 4.2.1.9) is essential for the biosynthesis of branched-chain amino acids and coenzyme A. It catalyzes the third step in branched-chain amino acid biosynthetic pathway which is depicted in Scheme I.
Enzymatic dehydrations of vicinal diols such as that carried out by dihydroxy-acid dehydratase can occur via an enol intermediate (1, 2) or the co-enzyme B12-mediated 1,2 intramolecular shift of a hydride ion (3). Arfin has shown that dihydroxy-acid dehydratase from Salmonella typhimurium acts via an enol intermediate with the loss of the proton from the a-carbon to solvent (2), and an analogous mechanism is presumed for the Escherichia coli enzyme. After the enol intermediate is formed, a tautomerization is required to reach the keto acid product. In the case of the isoleucine precursor, tautomerization in solution would lead to a racemic product. It has been shown that only the (3S) isomer is formed in the reaction catalyzed by E. coli dihydroxy-acid dehydratase (4). The tautomerization must therefore occur stereospecifically on the enzyme surface before the product is released into solution. The stereospecific tautomerization in the case of dihydroxy-acid dehydratase contrasts to 6-phosphogluconate dehydratase, another vicinal diol dehydratase, which releases the enol intermediate into the solution to tautomerize non-stereospecifically (1).
Dihydroxy-acid dehydratase has been previously purified from spinach (Spinach oleracea) leaves (5). The plant enzyme is a homodimer and the subunit molecular weight was determined by SDS-gel electrophoresis to be 63,000. Each subunit contains 2 mol of non-heme iron and 2 mol of acid labile sulfur and the UV visible absorption and EPR spectra are consistent with one [2Fe-2SI2+.+ cluster/subunit (5). Of particular interest was the observation of dramatic changes in the spectroscopic properties of the [2Fe-2S] cluster that accompany substrate binding. For example, the addition of substrate converts the heterogeneous EPR spectrum of the reduced native enzyme, which comprises a mixture of two Rieske-center-type resonances (gav = 1.91 and 1.92), to a homogeneous resonance (gav = 1.95) resembling those of plant-type ferredoxins. These results suggest direct involvement of the [2Fe-2S] cluster in the catalytic mechanism. A similar conclusion has been reached for the catalytic involvement of the [4Fe-4S] cluster of another member of the hydrolyase class, mitochondrial aconitase (hereafter referred to as aconitase) (6). 
Dihydroxy-acid dehydratase from E. coli has been reported to be an unstable enzyme (7-9) and has not previously been isolated in pure form. Brown and co-workers (10) have shown that E. coli grown in minimal media become starved for branched-chain amino acids in the presence of hyperbaric O2, due to the inactivation of dihydroxy-acid dehydratase in vivo (11). Dihydroxy-acid dehydratase has also been reported to be inactivated in vivo when E. coli was grown aerobically in the presence of paraquat (12). Fridovich and co-workers have obtained indirect evidence that dihydroxy-acid dehydratase from E. coli was sensitive to 02- (9). Heretofore, no rationale for the unusual sensitivity of this enzyme to O2 and 0; has been advanced. It is shown in this paper that dihydroxy-acid dehydratase contains a [4Fe-4S] cluster which is essential for catalysis and unstable in the presence of O2 and O;, thus providing an explanation for the sensitivity of this enzyme to these oxidants

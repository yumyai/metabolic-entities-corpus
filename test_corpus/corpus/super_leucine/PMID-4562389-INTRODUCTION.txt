The isoleucine and valine biosynthetic pathway (Fig. 1) consists of five enzymatic steps that are specified in Escherichia coli, and presumably in Salmonella typhimurium as well, by a cluster of five ilv genes designated A through E (18). Arfin et al. (1) showed that the expression of the ilvC gene which encodes the a-acetohydroxy acid isomeroreductase is not controlled directly by end-product repression by isoleucine, valine, and leucine, as are the other isoleucine- and valine-forming enzymes in E. coli and S. typhimurium (6, 7). Rather, the isomeroreductase is induced by its substrates, a-acetolactate and a-acetohydroxybutyrate, even when the levels of the other isolecuine- and valine-forming enzymes are repressed by the addition of all three branched-chain amino acids to the medium. This finding complements the previous observations on the apparently anomalous behavior of this enzyme by Ramakrishnan and Adelberg (17). They observed, in E. coli K-12, that neither the ilvO gene, which is thought to be the repression recognition site for the ilvADE gene cluster, nor the ilvP gene, which is the corresponding site for the ilvB gene, governed the expression of the ilvC gene. It had therefore been inferred, but never demonstrated, that the ilvC gene would be under the control of a third regulatory element in the ilv cluster. Preliminary evidence for such a control element between ilvB and ilvC has been reported (B. Ratzkin, W. J. Pledger, and H. E. Umbarger, Fed. Proc. 30:1264, 1971).
This communication presents further evidence supporting the inducibility of isomeroreductase. In addition, studies on the mechanism of the induction process are reported.

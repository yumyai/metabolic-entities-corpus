The following four enzymes are involved in threonine degradation by microorganisms. Threonine dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.103) degrades threonine to a-amino-fi-ketobutyrate in Escherichia coli (29), an Arthrobacter species (21), and others (3, 6, 19). Threonine aldolase (EC 2.1.2.1) cleaves threonine to acetaldehyde and glycine in some microorganisms (10, 17, 24, 33). Threonine deaminase (EC 4.2.1.16) converts threonine to a-ketobutyrate and ammonium ion. In E. coli (9, 30) and Salmonella typhimurium (20), "catabolic" threonine deaminase degrades threonine under anaerobic culture conditions. "Biosynthetic" threonine deaminase is possibly concerned with threonine degradation as well as with isoleucine biosynthesis (4).
During a study on isoleucine production from threonine, we observed that a wild strain of Serratia marcescens rapidly degraded threonine (11). Moreover, we obtained regulatory mutants producing large amounts of isoleucine in a medium containing glucose and urea (13, 15). This finding indicated that S. marcescens possesses a high potential activity for threonine synthesis. Therefore, we expected that S. marcescens would produce large amounts of threonine if threonine degradation was prevented and threonine biosynthesis was released from feedback controls.
To establish microbial production of threonine, we examined threonine degradation by S. marcescens, isolated a mutant deficient in the degrading enzymes, and, furthermore, derived regulatory mutants from it. This paper deals with the features of threonine degradation by S. marcescens.

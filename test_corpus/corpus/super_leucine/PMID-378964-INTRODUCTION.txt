In Escherichia coli, four major transaiinases have been identified. They are the aromatic amino acid transaminase (7, 9, 10, 25, 26), the aspartate transaminase (4, 7, 9, 10, 26), transaminase B (22, 28), and transaminase C (21). The aromatic amino acid transaminase is the product of tyrB; it can be repressed by tyrosine and interacts not only with the aromatic amino acids and glutamate, but also with leucine, aspartate, and methionine. The aspartate transaminase is coded for by aspC and reacts with aspartate and glutamate and also with aromatic amino acids. The classification of the tyrB and aspC gene products as aromatic amino acid transaminase and aspartate transaminase, respectively, is justified on the basis of their substrate affinities (26). Transaminase B is coded for by ilvE (17, 27), is subject to multivalent repression (16, 17), and has been shown to interact with glutamate, leucine, isoleucine, valine, phenylalanine, and methionine (22, 28), although the relative affinities of the substrates have not been established. Transaminase C, finally, catalyzes the interconversion of valine, alanine, and a-aminobutyrate. It is repressed by either valine or leucine (20). The exact map location of the gene coding for this enzyme is not yet known.
Transaminase B has received renewed attention because of recent experimental results which suggest that the ilvE gene is located proximal to ilvO, a control region for the ilvGOEDA operon (1, 5, 29). Since the DNA sequence of this region is presently being studied (H. E. Umbarger and G. McCorkle, personal communication; G. W. Hatfield, personal communication), it seemed useful to establish at least a partial amino acid sequence of the enzymes whose structural genes are in the neighborhood of ilvO. We report here the sequence of 15 residues of the amino-terminal region of transaminase B. We also provide a more complete picture of the quaternary structure and the substrate specificity of this enzyme and address the recently raised question (12) of the existence of a separate valine-a-ketoglutarate transaminase.

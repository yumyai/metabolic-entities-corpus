The work of Rudman and Meister (1) has provided evidence that the final step in the biosynthesis of both isoleucine and valine in Escherichia coli is carried out by the same enzyme, a transaminase which mediates the transfer of an amino group from glutamate to any of several aliphatic a-keto acids. The requirement of certain mutants for both isoleucine and valine thus arises from the fact that this transaminase is absent in such mutants (1, 2). A similar situation appears to exist in the case of another class of isoleucine-valine-requiring mutants which accumulate the isoleucine precursor a,b-dihydroxy b-methyl-valeric acid and the valine precursor a,b-dihydroxyisovaleric acid. Extracts of wild type E. coli and Neurospora crassa are capable of converting a,b-dihydroxy b-methylvaleric acid and a,b-dihydroxyisovaleric acid to the corresponding a-keto acids,
a,b-dihydroxy b-methylvalerate --> a-keto b-methylvalerate
and
a,b-dihydroxyisovalerate --> a-ketoisovalerate,
whereas extracts of the above mentioned class of mutants are deficient with respect to both activities (3). In order to determine whether the reactions are in fact the result of the action of a single enzyme, partial purification of extracts of E. coli was carried out, and the properties of the enzyme system were determined. In addition, studies were made of the relative thermostability and the chromatographic behavior of the two activities and of competitive interactions between the two substrates. The results support the conclusion that a single enzyme is responsible for both reactions. The enzyme has been named dihydroxy acid dehydrase.

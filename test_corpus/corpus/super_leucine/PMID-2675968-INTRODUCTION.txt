Acetohydroxy acid synthase (AHAS, EC 4.1.3.18, also known as acetolactate synthase) catalyzes the condensation of an acetaldehyde moiety derived from pyruvate either with another molecule of pyruvate to form 2-acetolactate (AL, eq 1) or with 2-ketobutyrate to form 2-aceto-2-hydroxybutyrate (AHB, eq 2).
The synthesis.of these acetohydroxy acids is the first of a series of common steps in the biosynthesis of the branched-chain amino acids (Umbarger, 1978, 1987). The two AHAS reactions are key steps in these pathways, as they are irreversible and committed steps toward the synthesis of two different sets of products, valine (and leucine) or isoleucine. Considerable interest in this enzyme has also arisen recently from the discovery that it is a good target for herbicides (La Rossa & Schloss, 1984; Shaner et al., 1984; Ray, 1986). 
At least three different AHAS isozymes, differing in genetic loci and control as well as in physiological and biochemical parameters, have been recognized in the enteric bacteria. The genes ilvBN, ilvGM, and ilvIH, which code for the isozymes known as AHAS I, 11, and 111, respectively, have been cloned
and sequenced (Friden et al., 1985; Wek et al., 1985; Lawther et ai., 1981; Squires et al., 1983). By use of bacterial clones producing large quantities of a single isozyme it is possible to isolate each enzyme in significant quantities. AHAS I (Eoyang & Silverman, 1984), AHAS I1 (Schloss et al., 1985), and AHAS I11 (Barak et al., 1988) have been purified essentially to homogeneity. The availability of isolated enzymes, together with a gas chromatographic method for the simultaneous quantitative assay of AL and AHB (Gollop et al., 1987), allowed us to study the substrate specificity of the various AHAS isozymes and to propose a quantitative picture of their physiological roles under different conditions (Barak et al., 1987). This method has also made it possible to study the steady-state kinetics of an AHAS isozyme in the presence of both pyruvate and 2-ketobutyrate. Because pyruvate is a common substrate in both reactions, as well as an alternative substrate (to 2-ketobutyrate) in one of them (eq 1 and 2), the steady-state kinetics can provide considerable information about the mechanism of the enzyme.
In this paper, we describe in detail steady-state kinetic studies of purified Escherichia coli AHAS 111. Comparison of these data with less extensive data on AHAS I and I1 indicates that all three isozymes have similar mechanisms, despite significant quantitative differences among them.

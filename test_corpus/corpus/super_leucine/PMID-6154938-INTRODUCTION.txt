The ilvGEDA genes of Escherichia coli K-12 are multivalently regulated by the percent aminoacylation of tRNAVal, tRNAIle, and tRNALeu (1, 2), and strains containing altered Rho factor exhibit increased expression of this operon (3, 4). It has, therefore, been suggested that this operon might be regulated by an attenuator mechanism (3-5) similar to that proposed for several other amino acid biosynthetic operons (6-11). We have now defined the location of the regulatory region for the ilvGEDA operon as being promoter proximal to the livG gene. We show that a previously described short RNA transcript is an ilv leader RNA which is transcribed from the regulatory region. We designate the probable sites of transcriptional initiation and termination of this leader RNA by in vitro transcription. We also report here the DNA sequence of the IlvGEDA promoter-attenuator region and show that it contains multiple codons for isoleucine, valine, and leucine within a potential coding region for a short leader polypeptide. On the basis of these results and by analysis of the possible secondary structures of the ilv leader RNA, we conclude that this operon is regulated by translational control of transcription termination at an attenuator site (12, 13).

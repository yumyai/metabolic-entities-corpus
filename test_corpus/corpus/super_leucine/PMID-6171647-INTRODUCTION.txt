The enzymes responsible for leucine biosynthesis are encoded by contiguous genes on the chromosomes of Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium (Yang ok Kessler, 1973; Somers et al., 1978: Margolin, 1963). These genes, leuABCD, are transcribed as a unit and regulated by an adjacent control region (Calve et al., 1969a). Maximum expression of this operon is achieved by growing leucine auxotrophs in a chemostat under conditions of leucine limitation. Under these condibions the amounts of leu enzymes and Zeu-specific messenger RNA found in cells are elevated 50 and 25-fold, respectively, over the levels found when cells are grown in minimal medium with excess leucine (Cairo et al., 1969a; Davis & Cairo.  1977a : Hertzbtarg et al., 1980).  The results of DNA sequencing studies and transcription experiments in vitro suggest that the leu operon of S. typhimurium is controlled by a transcription attenuation mechanism (Gemmill et al., 1979). More recent studies indicate that transcription attenuation indeed occurs in viva and that this is the major mechanism by which the leucine operon of S. typhimurium is controlled in cells grown in minimal medium (Searles. Wessler & Calve, unpublished data).
The results described here indicate that the leu operon of E. coli is also regulated by a transcription attenuation mechanism. This is not surprising in view of the many other characteristics shared by Salmonella and Escherichia (Bachman. 1080: Sanderson. 1980). However, a comparison of the nrwleotide sequences showed that.  while the leu control regions of the two organisms are organized in a similar fashion.  there is a considerable number of base changes (30 differences out of 165 nueleotides for the leu leader alone). The parts of the control region that are most highl) conserved include the promoter. signals related to translation (ribosome binding sites, initiation and termination codons), and certain palindromic regions. These results support current notions about, the roles of leader RNA secondary structure and the coupling of transcription with translation in the attenuation mechanism (Lee & Yanofsky. 1977: Zurawski et al., 1978a: Dinocera et al., 1978: Gardner. 1979: Gemmill et al., 1979: Nargang et al., 1980: Lawther & Hatfield. 1980).

Among the many regulatory enzymes which have been studied, the biosynthetic L-threonine deaminase from Escherichia coli K-12 has perhaps had a greater influence on the concepts of biological control than any other. In 1956, Umbarger showed that this enzyme from E. coli, the first enzyme in the biosynthetic pathway leading to the ultimate formation of L-isoleucine, was inhibited effectively by the end product of this pathway (1). This was the first demonstration of the now familiar phenomenon of end product inhibition which has since been shown for virtually every biosynthetic pathway. Furthermore, the formation of the concept of allostery as a regulatory mechanism, proposed by Monod et al. in 1963 (2) and formalized by Monod et al. in 1965 (3), was based, at least partially, on kinetic data obtained from the E. coli K-12 L-threonine deaminase by Changeux (4). Until now, however, although this enzyme has been purified from other bacterial sources (5-10), it has not been purified from E. coli. Therefore, it has not been possible heretofore to study the physical properties of this enzyme which has played such a historically significant role in shaping our view of cellular regulatory mechanisms. These studies are now possible. The present study presents the procedure for the purification of the biosynthetic L-threonine deaminase from E. coli K-12 and some of its basic physical parameters.

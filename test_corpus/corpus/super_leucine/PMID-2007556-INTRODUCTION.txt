In Escherichia coli, the multivalent regulation of the ilvGMEDA operon by the three branched-chain amino acids appears to be achieved exclusively via an attenuation mechanism (2, 21, 22, 26). In the preceding report (4), the specificity of the ilvGMEDA regulatory region was examined with respect to the amino acids that, upon limitation, would lead to derepression or when added singly to minimal medium-grown cells would lead to repression. Although the 32-amino-acid peptide-coding region of the ilv leader transcript contains 14 branched-chain amino acid codons between positions 4 and 20, there are interspersed among them, at position 6, a codon for arginine, and at positions 9 and 14, two codons for serine. Neither limitation of these non-branched-chain amino acids in an auxotrophic strain nor their supplementation in a prototrophic strain had any effect on ilv operon control as measured by P-galactosidase activity expressed from an ilv-lac operon fusion.
Here we report experiments to address this specificity by site-specific mutagenesis of the ilv leader region. The experimental results support the concept that translation of the leader transcript is delayed until a significant portion of the transcript has been formed and the polymerase has reached the pause site (15). They also raise the possibility that the nascent leader peptide can influence the efficiency of the attenuation mechanism.

## Better resolving reaction <-> Better annotation scheme.
The acetohydroxy acid synthases (EC 4.1.3.18) of microorganisms have been found to catalyze two homologous reactions involving the condensation of an active acetaldehyde group derived from pyruvate, with either pyruvate, to form acetolactate, or a-ketobutyrate, to form acetohydroxybutyrate

## So, what should I do with these "transfering", and site?
Purified transaminase B catalyzed transamination between alpha-ketoglutarate and l-isoleucine, l-leucine, l-valine, and, to a lesser extent, l-phenylalanine and l-tyrosine, the latter reacting very sluggishly.


## Compound word event
You know, like "NADH-dependent reduction"

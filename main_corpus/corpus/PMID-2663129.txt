2-Oxoaldehyde metabolism in microorganisms.
The properties of methylglyoxal-metabolizing enzymes in prokaryotic and eukaryotic microorganisms were studied systematically and compared with those of mammalian enzymes. The enzymes constitute a glycolytic bypass and convert methylglyoxal into pyruvate via lactate. The first step in this conversion is catalyzed by glyoxalase I, methylglyoxal reductase, or methylglyoxal dehydrogenase. The regulation of the yeast glyoxalase system was analyzed. The system was closely related to the proliferative states of yeast cells, the activity of the system being high in dividing cells and low in nondividing ones. The gene for the glyoxalase I of Pseudomonas putida and the genes responsible for the activity of glyoxalase I and methylglyoxal reductase in Saccharomyces cerevisiae were cloned and their structural and phenotypic characters studied.

The aconitase of Escherichia coli was purified to homogeneity, albeit in low yield (0.6%). It was shown to be a monomeric protein of Mr 95,000 or 97,500 by gel filtration and SDS-PAGE analysis, respectively. The N-terminal amino acid sequence resembled that of the Bacillus subtilis enzyme (citB product), but the similarity at the DNA level was insufficient to allow detection of the E. coli acn gene using a 456 bp citB probe. Phages containing the acn gene were isolated from a lambda-E. coli gene bank by immunoscreening with an antiserum raised against purified bacterial enzyme. The acn gene was located at 28 min (1350 kb) in the physical map of the E. coli chromosome by probing Southern blots with a fragment of the gene. Attempts to locate the gene using the same procedure with oligonucleotide probes encoding segments of the N-terminal amino acid sequence were complicated by the lack of probe specificity and an inaccuracy in the physical map of Kohara et al. (Cell 50, 495-508, 1987). Aconitase specific activity was amplified some 20-200-fold in cultures transformed with pGS447, a derivative of pUC119 containing the acn gene, and an apparent four-fold activation-deactivation of the phagemid-encoded enzyme was observed in late exponential phase. The aconitase antiserum cross-reacted with both the porcine and Salmonella typhimurium (Mr 120,000) enzymes.

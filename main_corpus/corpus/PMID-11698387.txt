The rlmB gene is essential for formation of Gm2251 in 23S rRNA but not for ribosome maturation in Escherichia coli.
In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the rRNA Gm2270 methyltransferase, Pet56p, has an essential role in the maturation of the mitochondrial large ribosomal subunit that is independent of its methyltransferase activity. Here we show that the proposed Escherichia coli ortholog, RlmB (formerly YjfH), indeed is essential for the formation of Gm in position 2251 of 23S rRNA. However, a DeltarlmB mutant did not show any ribosome assembly defects and was not outgrown by a wild-type strain even after 120 cell mass doublings. Thus, RlmB has no important role in ribosome assembly or function in E. coli.

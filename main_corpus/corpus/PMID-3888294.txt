Roles of the trkB and trkC gene products of Escherichia coli in K+ transport.
Mutations at the trkB and trkC loci of Escherichia coli produce an abnormal efflux of K+. The mutations are partially dominant in diploids and revert frequently by what appears to be intragenic suppression to the null state. The mutations can be reverted by insertion of Tn10 into the mutated gene, and spontaneous revertants are fully recessive to the mutant allele in diploids. K+ efflux produced by NEM* and by DNP* persists in strains with presumed null mutations at either locus, indicating neither gene product is the primary target for the effect of these inhibitors on K+ efflux. The results are consistent with the view that trkB and trkC encode independent systems for K+ efflux. Mutations at these loci alter regulation of the process so that K+ efflux occurs inappropriately. A second mutation to the null state abolishes this abnormal K+ efflux. These genes may encode K+/H+ antiporters, an activity postulated to mediate K+ efflux and demonstrated to exist in E. coli and other bacteria.

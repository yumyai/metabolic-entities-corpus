Purification and phosphorylation of the Arc regulatory components of Escherichia coli.
In Escherichia coli, a two-component signal transduction system, consisting of the transmembrane sensor protein ArcB and its cognate cytoplasmic regulatory protein ArcA, controls the expression of genes encoding enzymes involved in aerobic respiration. ArcB belongs to a subclass of sensors that have not only a conserved histidine-containing transmitter domain but also a conserved aspartate-containing receiver domain of the regulator family. 'ArcB (a genetically truncated ArcB missing the two transmembrane segments on the N-terminal end) and ArcA were purified from overproducing cells. Autophosphorylation of 'ArcB was revealed when the protein was incubated with [gamma-32P]ATP but not with [alpha-32P]ATP or [gamma-32P]GTP. When ArcA was incubated in the presence of 'ArcB and [gamma-32P]ATP, ArcA acquired radioactivity at the expense of the phosphorylated protein 'ArcB-32P. When a limited amount of 'ArcB was incubated with excess ArcA and [gamma-32P]ATP, ArcA-32P increased linearly with time. Under such conditions, for a given time period the amount of ArcA phosphorylated was proportional to the concentration of 'ArcB. Thus, 'ArcB acted as a kinase for ArcA. Chemical stabilities of the phosphorylated proteins suggested that 'ArcB-32P contained both a histidyl phosphate and an aspartyl phosphate(s) and that ArcA-32P contained only an aspartyl phosphate(s).

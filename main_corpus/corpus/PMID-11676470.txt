Hydrolysis of oxidized nucleotides by the Escherichia coli Orf135 protein.
To examine the possibility that the Orf135 protein of Escherichia coli functions as a hydrolyzing enzyme for a damaged DNA precursor (deoxyribonucleoside 5'-triphosphate), we purified the recombinant Orf135 protein and incubated it with oxidized deoxynucleotides. Of the nucleotides tested, 2-hydroxydeoxyadenosine 5'-triphosphate, and somewhat less efficiently, 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine 5'-triphosphate, were hydrolyzed by this protein. These damaged deoxynucleotides elicit transversion mutations in E. coli (Inoue, M., Kamiya, H., Fujikawa, K., Ootsuyama, Y., Murata-Kamiya, N., Osaki, T., Yasumoto, K., Kasai, H. (1998) J. Biol. Chem. 273, 11069-11074). These results suggest that this protein may be involved in the prevention of mutations induced by these oxidized deoxynucleotides.

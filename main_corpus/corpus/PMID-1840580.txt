Molecular analysis of the cryptic and functional phn operons for phosphonate use in Escherichia coli K-12.
We cloned the cryptic phn operon of a K-12 strain, phn(EcoK), and analyzed the nucleotide sequence of the phn region (11,672 bp). An mRNA start site upstream of the phnC gene was identified by S1 nuclease mapping. The pho regulon activator PhoB protects a pho box region near the mRNA start in DNase I footprinting and methylation protection experiments. The sequence of the cryptic phn(EcoK) operon was very similar to that of the functional phn operon of an Escherichia coli B strain, phn(EcoB) (C.-M. Chen, Q.-Z. Ye, Z. Zhu, B. L. Wanner, and C. T. Walsh, J. Biol. Chem. 265:4461-4471, 1990). The phnE(EcoK) gene has an 8-bp insertion, absent from the phnE(EcoB) gene, which causes a frameshift mutation. The spontaneous activation of the cryptic phn(EcoK) operon is accompanied by loss of this additional 8-bp insertion. Studies of the structure, regulation, and function of the phn region suggest that the phosphate starvation-inducible phn operon consists of 14 cistrons from phnC to phnP.

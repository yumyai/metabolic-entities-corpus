To facilitate molecular analyses of a previously uncharacterized gene involved in alanine synthesis, attempts were made to clone the wild-type allele of this gene, alaA, with a mini-Mu plasmid element used for in vivo cloning. Seventy-six independent Ala+ plasmids were isolated and characterized. Physiological, enzymological, and restriction endonuclease analyses indicated that three different genes, none of them alaA, were cloned. These genes were avtA+, which encodes the alanine-valine transaminase (transaminase C); tyrB+, which encodes the tyrosine-repressible transaminase (transaminase D); and a previously undescribed gene, called alaB, which encodes an alanine-glutamate transaminase.

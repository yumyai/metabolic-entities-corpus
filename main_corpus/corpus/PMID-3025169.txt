Negative modulation of Escherichia coli NAD kinase by NADPH and NADH.
NAD kinase was purified 93-fold from Escherichia coli. The enzyme was found to have a pH optimum of 7.2 and an apparent Km for NAD+, ATP, and Mg2+ of 1.9, 2.1, and 4.1 mM, respectively. Several compounds including quinolinic acid, nicotinic acid, nicotinamide, nicotinamide mononucleotide, AMP, ADP, and NADP+ did not affect NAD kinase activity. The enzyme was not affected by changes in the adenylate energy charge. In contrast, both NADH and NADPH were potent negative modulators of the enzyme, since their presence at micromolar concentrations resulted in a pronounced sigmoidal NAD+ saturation curve. In addition, the presence of a range of concentrations of the reduced nucleotides resulted in an increase of the Hill slope (nH) to 1.7 to 2.0 with NADH and to 1.8 to 2.1 with NADPH, suggesting that NAD kinase is an allosteric enzyme. These results indicate that NAD kinase activity is regulated by the availability of ATP, NAD+, and Mg2+ and, more significantly, by changes in the NADP+/NADPH and NAD+/NADH ratios. Thus, NAD kinase probably plays a role in the regulation of NADP turnover and pool size in E. coli.

The operator-distal genes hisBHAFI(E) of the Escherichia coli K-12 histidine operon were mapped on a DNA fragment 4,500 base pairs long. This fragment, originally present in a lambda transducing phage, was cloned in the vector plasmid pBR313. A restriction map was determined, allowing identification of the orientation of the genes in the fragment. The cloned genes were expressed in appropriate hosts, independent of the orientation of the DNA fragment, as shown by transformation tests and by enzyme assays of one of the gene products, hisB, histidinol phosphatase. An internal transcription initiation site was identified by isolation of the cellular RNA, hybridization to specific DNA probes, and mapping by S1 nuclease.

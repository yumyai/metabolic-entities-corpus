The structural gene of pyruvate formate-lyase (pfl) and that of pyruvate-formate-lyase-activating enzyme were shown to be adjacent on the chromosomal map of Escherichia coli. DNA sequencing was performed along a stretch of 3592 nucleotides to obtain the amino acid sequences of both proteins. The derived primary structures (759 and 245 residues) were confirmed by partial structure analyses on the purified proteins. The open reading frames are separated by a 194-nucleotide stretch, and their flanking regions include signal elements that are compatible with separate control of protein synthesis from the two genes.

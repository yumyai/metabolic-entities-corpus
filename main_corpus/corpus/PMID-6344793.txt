Amplification of D-xylose and D-glucose isomerase activities in Escherichia coli by gene cloning.
A recombinant plasmid, designated pUC1002, was constructed by ligation of a HindIII restriction endonuclease fragment of Escherichia coli chromosomal DNA to vector plasmid pMB9. Strains carrying this plasmid were selected by transformation of an E. coli strain bearing the xyl-7 mutation to a xylose-positive (Xyl+) phenotype. Strains containing pUC1002 produced coordinately elevated levels of D-xylose isomerase and D-xylulose kinase. Under appropriate conditions, the isomerase also efficiently catalyzed the conversion of D-glucose to D-fructose.

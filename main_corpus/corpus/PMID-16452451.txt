MurQ Etherase is required by Escherichia coli in order to metabolize anhydro-N-acetylmuramic acid obtained either from the environment or from its own cell wall.
MurQ is an N-acetylmuramic acid-phosphate (MurNAc-P) etherase that converts MurNAc-P to N-acetylglucosamine-phosphate and is essential for growth on MurNAc as the sole source of carbon (T. Jaegar, M. Arsic, and C. Mayer, J. Biol. Chem. 280:30100-30106, 2005). Here we show that MurQ is the only MurNAc-P etherase in Escherichia coli and that MurQ and AnmK kinase are required for utilization of anhydro-MurNAc derived either from cell wall murein or imported from the medium.

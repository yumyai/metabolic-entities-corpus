Efflux of beta-galactosidase products from Escherichia coli.
Several different strains of Escherichia coli were grown on a variety of carbon sources under various growth conditions. Lactose was added (usually at mid-log phase), and the concentrations of the products of beta-galactosidase action on this sugar (galactose, glucose, and allolactose) were determined at various times thereafter in the total culture and in the medium. It was found that with each strain, with all carbon sources, and under all of the conditions studied, a very large proportion of the products were found in the medium. Control studies were carried out which showed that these results were not artifacts of the method of separating the cells from the medium. The results also did not arise from the secretion of beta-galactosidase into the medium, from the diffusion of substrates and products into and out of the cells due to leaks in the membrane, or from faults in the method of sugar analysis. In addition, the results showed that there were very high levels of products inside the cells under the conditions used and that the efflux of the products was rapid. The efflux might be energetically advantageous to the cell as well as being a means of storing excess products until needed.

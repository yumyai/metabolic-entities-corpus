Guanylate kinase of Escherichia coli K-12.
We have identified the gene gmk, in the same operon as rpoZ, spoT, and recG at about 82 minutes on the Escherichia coli chromosome. The gmk (GMP kinase) gene encodes a peptide of 23,592 Da, possessing extensive similarity to the amino acid sequence of guanylate kinase from yeast. To confirm that gmk truly encodes guanylate kinase and to explore some of its enzymatic features, we have overproduced the product of gmk and purified it to homogeneity. Unlike guanylate kinases purified from eukaryotic sources, E. coli guanylate kinase is multimeric, and ionic conditions dictate its protomeric state; under low ionic conditions it appears to be a tetramer while under high ionic conditions it is a dimer. Kinetic analysis reveals that guanylate kinase, again, unlike eukaryotic guanylate kinases, binds GMP cooperatively and that the observed cooperatively changes with ionic strength. These results indicate that, despite extensive sequence similarity to its eukaryotic counterparts, E. coli guanylate kinase is structurally and enzymatically different.

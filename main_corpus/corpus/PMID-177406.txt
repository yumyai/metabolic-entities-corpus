Phosphofructokinase (pfkA) mutants of Escherichia coli are impaired in growth on all carbon sources entering glycolysis at or above the level of fructose 6-phosphate (nonpermissive carbon sources), but growth is particularly slow on sugars, such as glucose, which are normally transported and phosphorylated by the phosphoenolpyruvate, (PEP)-dependent phosphotransferase system (PTS).

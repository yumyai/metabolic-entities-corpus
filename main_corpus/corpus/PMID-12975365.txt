Oxygen-dependent coproporphyrinogen III oxidase (HemF) from Escherichia coli is stimulated by manganese.
During heme biosynthesis in Escherichia coli two structurally unrelated enzymes, one oxygen-dependent (HemF) and one oxygen-independent (HemN), are able to catalyze the oxidative decarboxylation of coproporphyrinogen III to form protoporphyrinogen IX. Oxygen-dependent coproporphyrinogen III oxidase was produced by overexpression of the E. coli hemF in E. coli and purified to apparent homogeneity. The dimeric enzyme showed a Km value of 2.6 microm for coproporphyrinogen III with a kcat value of 0.17 min-1 at its optimal pH of 6. HemF does not utilize protoporphyrinogen IX or coproporphyrin III as substrates and is inhibited by protoporphyrin IX. Molecular oxygen is essential for the enzymatic reaction. Single turnover experiments with oxygen-loaded HemF under anaerobic conditions demonstrated electron acceptor function for oxygen during the oxidative decarboxylation reaction with the concomitant formation of H2O2. Metal chelator treatment inactivated E. coli HemF. Only the addition of manganese fully restored coproporphyrinogen III oxidase activity. Evidence for the involvement of four highly conserved histidine residues (His-96, His-106, His-145, and His-175) in manganese coordination was obtained. One catalytically important tryptophan residue was localized in position 274. None of the tested highly conserved cysteine (Cys-167), tyrosine (Tyr-135, Tyr-160, Tyr-170, Tyr-213, Tyr-240, and Tyr-276), and tryptophan residues (Trp-36, Trp-123, Trp-166, and Trp-298) were found important for HemF activity. Moreover, mutation of a potential nucleotide binding motif (GGGXXTP) did not affect HemF activity. Two alternative routes for HemF-mediated catalysis, one metal-dependent, the other metal-independent, are proposed.

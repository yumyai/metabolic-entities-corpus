Identification of an iron uptake system specific for coprogen and rhodotorulic acid in Escherichia coli K12.
With the lac operon fusion technique, mutants were isolated in two genes that specify two outer membrane proteins designated FhuE (76 K) and Fiu (83 K). The synthesis of both proteins was increased under low iron growth conditions. The FhuE-protein was shown to be necessary for iron uptake via coprogen, an iron chelator produced by certain fungi, e.g. Neurospora crassa. In addition to fhueE the genes fhuCDB, tonB and exbB were necessary for iron coprogen uptake. The gene fhuE was mapped between kdp and gltA near 16 min on the genetic map of E. coli K12, while gene fiu was mapped near 18 min between chlA and chlE. Nor iron transport system could be assigned as yet to the Fiu protein.

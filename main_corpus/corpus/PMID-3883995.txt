A procedure was developed for the purification of shikimate dehydrogenase from Escherichia coli. Homogeneous enzyme with specific activity 1100 units/mg of protein was obtained in 21% overall yield. The subunit Mr estimated by polyacrylamide-gel electrophoresis in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulphate was 32 000. The native Mr, estimated by gel-permeation chromatography on a TSK G2000SW column, was also 32 000. E. coli shikimate dehydrogenase is therefore a monomeric NADP-linked dehydrogenase.

There exists in Escherichia coli a known set of enzymes that were shown to function in an efficient and concerted way to convert threonine to serine. The sequence of reactions catalyzed by these enzymes is designated the Tut cycle (threonine utilization). To demonstrate that the relevant genes and their protein products play essential roles in serine biosynthesis, a number of mutants were analyzed. Strains of E. coli with lesions in serA, serB, serC, or glyA grew readily on minimal medium supplemented with elevated levels of leucine, arginine, lysine, threonine, and methionine. No growth on this medium was observed upon testing double mutants with lesions in one of the known ser genes plus a second lesion in glyA (serine hydroxymethyltransferase), gcv (the glycine cleavage system), or tdh (threonine dehydrogenase). Pseudorevertants of ser mutants capable of growth on either unsupplemented minimal medium or medium supplemented with low levels of leucine, arginine, lysine, threonine, and methionine were isolated. At least two unlinked mutations were associated with such phenotypes.

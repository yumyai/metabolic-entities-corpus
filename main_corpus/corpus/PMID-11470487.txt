Identification of a mutation causing increased expression of the tas gene in Escherichia coli FX-11.
Studies of N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea (ENU)-induced mutagenesis with a tyrosine auxotroph of Escherichia coli revealed a new type of revertant. This mutant strain was interesting because: (i) it was not a true revertant of the nonsense (ochre) defect nor a tRNA suppressor mutation; and (ii) it was induced by ENU to greater extent in a UmuC-defective host. Genetic mapping located the probable mutation to a region of the E. coli chromosome containing a newly described gene called tas. To investigate this mutation, the upstream region of the tas gene from both wild-type and mutant cells was cloned into a promoterless lacZ expression vector and recombined onto a lambda bacteriophage. Recombinant bacteriophage were inserted into the bacterial chromosome and beta-galactosidase (betaGal) assays were performed. These assays revealed an almost three-fold greater expression of betaGal from the mutant DNA than from the wild-type DNA. Sequence analysis of the region directly upstream of the tas gene revealed a G:C to A:T transition at base number 2263 (numbering based on GenBank Accession #AE000367), located within a potential promoter site. Further sequencing indicated no other mutations within the 1454bp region analyzed; however, there were several nucleotide differences seen in our B/r strain of E. coli, when compared with the published E. coli K-12 sequence. A total of 10 base differences were discovered; one in mutH, six within a potential open reading frame (ORF-o237) and three in non-coding regions. Yet, none of the changes altered the predicted amino acid sequences. These results provide evidence of a mechanism for increased expression of the novel gene tas and support the neutral drift hypothesis for the evolution of DNA sequences.

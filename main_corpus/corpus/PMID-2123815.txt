Sequences of the genes encoding argininosuccinate synthetase in Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae: comparison with methanogenic archaebacteria and mammals.
The nucleotide (nt) sequences of the genes encoding argininosuccinate synthetase from Escherichia coli K-12 (argG) and Saccharomyces cerevisiae (ARG1) were determined. The deduced amino-acid sequences were compared to each other and to their counterparts in two methanogens and in mammals. Three regions are highly conserved. Two of them appear to contain possible Walker-type nt-binding sites [Walker et al., EMBO J. 1 (1982) 945-951] and are therefore candidates for ATP-binding sites. The third region shows some similarity to a short portion of the N-proximal part of the PurA enzyme which catalyses an analogous reaction.

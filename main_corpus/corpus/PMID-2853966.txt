Cobalamin-dependent methionine synthase (5-methyltetrahydrofolate-homocysteine methyltransferase, EC 2.1.1.13) has been isolated from Escherichia coli B in homogeneous form. The enzyme is isolated in an inactive form with the visible absorbance properties of cob(II)alamin. The inactive enzyme exhibits an electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectrum at 38 K that is characteristic of cob(II)alamin at acid pH, where the protonated dimethylbenzimidazole substituent is not coordinated with the cobalt nucleus (base-off cobalamin). An additional, variable component of the EPR spectrum of the inactive enzyme has the characteristics of a cob(III)alamin-superoxide complex. Previous work by others [Taylor, R.T., & Weissbach, H. (1969) Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 129, 745-766. Fujii, K., & Huennekens, F.M. (1979) in Biochemical Aspects of Nutrition (Yagi, K., Ed.) pp 173-183, Japan Scientific Societies, Tokyo] has demonstrated that the enzyme can be activated by reductive methylation using adenosylmethionine as the methyl donor. We present data indicating that the conversion of inactive to methylated enzyme is correlated with the disappearance of the EPR spectrum as expected for the conversion of paramagnetic cob(II)alamin to diamagnetic methylcobalamin. When the methyl group is transferred from the methylated enzyme to homocysteine under aerobic conditions, cob(II)alamin/cob(III)alamin-superoxide enzyme is regenerated as indicated by the return of the visible absorbance properties of the initially isolated enzyme and partial return of the EPR spectrum. Our enzyme preparations contain copper in approximately 1:1 stoichiometry with cobalt as determined by atomic absorption spectroscopy.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

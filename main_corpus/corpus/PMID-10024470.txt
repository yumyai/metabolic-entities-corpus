Ketol-acid reductoisomerase (EC 1.1.1.86) catalyzes the conversion of 2-aceto-2-hydroxyacids to 2-keto-3-hydroxyacids and their subsequent reduction by NADPH to 2,3-dihydroxyacids. The gene encoding the Escherichia coli enzyme was cloned and expressed as a hexahistidine-tagged fusion protein and the recombinant enzyme purified by metal-ligand affinity chromatography. The pure enzyme was tested for its ability to provide a sensitive and continuous coupled assay for acetohydroxyacid synthase (EC 4.1.3.18), the preceding enzyme in the pathway of branched-chain amino acid biosynthesis. An unexpected side reaction of ketol-acid reductoisomerase was observed in which it catalyzes the reduction of pyruvate. Although relatively slow, this side reaction is high enough to prohibit the use of this enzyme in a coupled assay for acetohydroxyacid synthase.

The DNA sequence of the gdhA gene of Escherichia coli K12, which encodes the 447 amino acid polypeptide subunit of NADP-specific glutamate dehydrogenase, is presented. The deduced protein sequence is strongly homologous to the corresponding enzyme of the eukaryotic fungus Neurospora crassa. The upstream DNA sequence includes several overlapping promoter consensus sequences. The downstream DNA sequence contains inverted repeats, predicted as forming long stable stem-loop structures in RNA, homologous to those found in several enterobacterial intergenic regions.

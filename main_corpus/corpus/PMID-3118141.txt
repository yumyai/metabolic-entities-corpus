Two classes of mutants defective in benzyl viologen-linked formate dehydrogenase (FDH-BV) activity were isolated from Escherichia coli K12. Class I consisted of four mutants which were specifically devoid of FDH-BV activity. Their mutation mapped between the ssb and melA genes at 92 min on the genome, at a site recently designated fdhF by Pecher et al. (1985). The direction of transcription of gene fdhF was found to be counterclockwise on the E. coli chromosome in one Mudl(Aprlac) fusion mutant. Expression of the lac operon in this mutant was induced by formate and repressed by nitrate, nitrite or trimethylamine N-oxide. It was found to be dependent on the positive control exerted by the fdhA, B and C genes, possibly involved in selenium incorporation, and by an hydB gene affecting the formate hydrogenlyase pathway. Class II, represented by one Mudl(Aprlac) mutant, exhibited no FDH-BV activity and a reduced level of hydrogenase activity. The relevant fdv mutation was shown to be located at 58 min and to affect the expression of fdhF.

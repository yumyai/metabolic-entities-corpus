Existence of two D-alanine:D-alanine ligases in Escherichia coli: cloning and sequencing of the ddlA gene and purification and characterization of the DdlA and DdlB enzymes.
Two distinct genes encoding D-alanine:D-alanine (D-Ala-D-Ala) ligase (ADP forming) activity in Escherichia coli have been cloned by complementation of E. coli strain ST640(lambda 112) deficient in D-Ala-D-Ala ligase activity with a lambda library of E. coli DNA. One of the two genes, designated as ddlB, is identical with the ddl gene already sequenced [Robinson, A.C., Kenan, D.L., Sweeney, J., & Donachie, W.D. (1986) J. Bacteriol. 167, 809-817]. We describe the subcloning and DNA sequencing of the other gene, designated as ddlA on the basis of similarities with the Salmonella typhimurium ddlA gene [Daub, E., Zawadzke, L.E., Botstein, D., & Walsh, C.T. (1988) Biochemistry 27, 3701-3708]. The predicted amino acid sequence of the E. coli DdlA enzyme shows 90% homology with the S. typhimurium DdlA sequence. The ddlB gene was subcloned by use of the polymerase chain reaction into an expression vector containing an optimized ribosome binding site, which expressed the DdlB enzyme to greater than 50% soluble cell protein. Both DdlA and DdlB enzymes were purified to greater than 90% homogeneity and characterized kinetically.

A simple statistical approach was used to generate predictive models of the proteolysis of multisubunit enzymes in order to correlate the loss of enzyme activity with the loss of native subunit. The models were applied to the trypsinolysis of the citrate synthases of pig heart, Bacillus megaterium and Escherichia coli. With the dimeric citrate synthases (pig heart and B. megaterium) trypsinolysis of one of the subunits appears to destroy the activity of the whole enzymic molecule. The hexameric E. coli citrate synthase behaves like a trimer of dimeric units, each of the dimers behaving similarly to the B. megaterium and pig heart enzymes. Palmitoyl-CoA is required for the trypsinolysis of pig heart citrate synthase, and at relatively high concentrations of this compound trypsinolysis of one subunit leaves the other subunit fully active. Palmitoyl-CoA is not required for the trypsinolysis of the other citrate synthases, and high concentrations of this metabolite do not affect the correlation of proteolysis with inactivation of these enzymes.

The Escherichia coli argB and argC gene products are functionally analogous to kinases and dehydrogenases of other pathways, which by their successive action also achieve the conversion of a carboxylate into an aldehyde function. This raises the question of possible evolutionary relationship within each of these sets of enzymes. We have therefore undertaken the nucleotide sequence analysis of the argB and argC genes and compared the derived amino acid sequences with the known sequences of analogous enzymes active in the proline and homoserine biosynthetic pathways and in glycolysis. No significant amino acid sequence similarity pointing to the existence of a common ancestor could be detected. Comparison of the amino acid sequence of the argB and argC gene products with the polypeptide deduced from the Saccharomyces cerevisiae ARG5,6 gene sequence (C. Boonchird, F. Messenguy and E. Dubois, in preparation) allowed the unambiguous localization of the corresponding domains in yeast.

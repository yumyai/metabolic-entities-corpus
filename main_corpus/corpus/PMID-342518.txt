Effects of phospholipids on L-lactate dehydrogenase from membranes of Escherichia coli. Activation and stabilization of the enzyme with phospholipids.
Membrane-bound L-lactate dehydrogenase was freed from the detergent used during purification. The detergent-free enzyme had about one-half the specific activity of the enzyme in 1.0% Tween 80, and was only partially sensitive to the specific antibody. This enzyme was activated about 3-fold with phosphatidylglycerol, cardiolipin, or a mixture of phospholipids. The phospholipid-activated enzyme had a similar Km value for L-lactate to that of the membrane enzyme and was completely inhibited by the specific antibody. On heat treatment, the phospholipid-activated enzyme was more stable than detergent-free enzyme and was as stable as membrane-bound enzyme. The alpha helical content of the enzyme increased 1.7-fold during preincubation with these lipids and the alpha helix became more stable during heat treatment than that of the detergent-free enzyme. These results suggest that the enzyme showed monomolecular dispersion in the lipid bilayer and that its conformation, including its active site and secondary structure, was different from that of the detergent-free enzyme. Phosphatidylethanolamine, dilauroyl lecithin and lecithin from egg yolk had none of the above effects on the activity or the secondary structure of the enzyme. On the other hand, mixtures of each of these lipids and cholate had essentially similar effects to phosphatidylglycerol.
